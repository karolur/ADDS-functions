# ADDS-functions
help on how to create ADDS1 ADDS2 and ADDS3 in python

This is just a guide for a function that writes another function. Code for ADDS3 works and returns the correct outputs but there are some wrong indentations and at the end there is an extra "return ..." that does nothing. When I did this i had no idea what a preorder, postorder, euler traversal was and i wish i had known. Hope this helps if you have to do the same proyect.
